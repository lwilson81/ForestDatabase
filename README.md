# ForestDatabase
Database for Forest

## Installation

Please have python and pip3 installed!


Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage


Create your very own .env file using env.sample as a template! The app currently using SQLite for easier
testing for our front-end, so for now, this step isn't required.

CD in API directory and start flask
```bash
$ cd api
$ flask run
```

You should see a localhost link in your terminal to access the frontend, something like http://127.0.0.1:5000/
